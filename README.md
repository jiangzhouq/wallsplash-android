#[Wallsplash] for Android
**[Wallsplash]** is the cutting edge wallpaper app for your device!

**[Wallsplash]** uses **Unsplash** and other platforms as image source, which already features over **2500 images**.

The current version includes following features:
* over 2500 images
* browse the images
* material design
* clean and minimalistic
* many animations
* set the wallpaper with a single click

This application was designed with the new material design principles in mind. It gives you a perfectly fluid user flow with simple and fresh animations. It also unleashes the full power of Android Lollipop by providing bright colors fetched out of each single wallpaper.
